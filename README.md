Project Description:

Apply data-wrangling and visualization tools from the tidyverse to musical data. Find the most common chords and chord progressions in a sample of pop/rock music from the 1950s-1990s, and compare the styles of different artists.
This project assumes familiarity with standard TidyVerse tools for R, in particular the tibble data structure and the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. No specific musical knowledge is required, though it may give us ideas for further exploration of the dataset after completing the project.
This project uses a parsed and cleaned version of the McGill Billboard Dataset, version 2.0 (CC0 license).
